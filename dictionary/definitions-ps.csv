"Private | The private access modifier in Java restricts the visibility of a class member to only within the same class, enabling encapsulation and preventing direct external access."
Encapsulation | is like putting your code in a safe box where only certain methods (functions) can access and change what's inside. It helps keep things organized and secure.
"Setters-Getters | Setters, named with ""set,"" allow you to put a new value into a private variable, updating information. Getters, named with ""get,"" act like messengers, helping you peek at the current value of a private variable, providing a controlled way to access information stored inside an object. "
